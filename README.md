## Introduction

Vector Borne Diseases are illnesses transmitted by vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas. The prevalence and spread of these diseases are closely linked to various environmental factors, including climate conditions. This project aims to employ machine learning techniques to analyze climate-based data along with symptom-based information to create a predictive model for the occurrence and spread of VBD.

## Objective

The primary objectives of this project include:

1. **Early Detection:** Develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of VBD outbreaks based on climate data.
2. **Symptom Analysis:** Incorporate symptom-based data to enhance the accuracy of the prediction model.
3. **Robustness:** Create a robust and scalable model that can adapt to changing environmental conditions and emerging disease patterns.
4. **Open Collaboration:** Encourage open collaboration and contributions from the community to improve the effectiveness of the model.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes diverse datasets, including:

- **Climate Data:** Historical and real-time climate data to understand the impact of temperature, humidity, and precipitation on vector populations.
- **Symptom-based Data:** Patient records and symptom data to identify patterns related to VBD.

## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant climate and symptom-based data from reliable sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values and ensure consistency.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract meaningful features from the data to improve model performance.
4. **Model Development:** Employ machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for VBD.
5. **Validation:** Validate the model using historical data and assess its performance.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the model in a scalable and user-friendly manner for real-time predictions.

## Installation
